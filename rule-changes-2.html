          <p class="lead">
            George Mikan, nicknamed "Mr. Basketball," was one of the most
            influential players in the early days of professional basketball.
            His dominance and unique playing style led to several significant
            rule changes in the sport.

          <dl class="lead">
            <dt><strong>The Goaltending Rule:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              Mikan's ability to swat away shots near the rim led to the
              introduction of the goaltending rule in college basketball in
              1944.
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>The "Mikan Rule":</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              The NBA widened the lane from 6 to 12 feet in 1951 to reduce
              Mikan's dominance near the basket.

            <dt><strong>The Shot Clock:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              Mikan's offensive prowess indirectly led to the introduction of
              the 24-second shot clock in the 1954-55 season.

            Barkley was a menace in the shaded area despite being undersized. To
            alleviate the lack of size, Barkley often
            <strong>backed down</strong> bigger defenders for a
            <em>lengthy</em> amount of time before attempting a shot. In order
            to quicken the pace of the game, the league responded by imposing
            the <strong>five second rule</strong> or the

            Paul George suffered a severe leg injury during a Team USA scrimmage
            on August 1, 2014, while preparing for the FIBA World Cup. The
            injury occurred when George's leg collided with the basket stanchion
            as he attempted to block a fast-break layup.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Following this incident, the NBA did indeed make changes to improve
            player safety:

          <dl class="lead">
            <dt><strong>Increased stanchion distance:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              The league mandated that the basket stanchion be placed at least 4
              feet from the baseline, increasing the space between players and
              the structure.
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>Padding requirements:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              Additional padding was required around the stanchion to provide
              extra protection in case of collisions.
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>Photographer positioning:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              The league also implemented stricter rules on where photographers
              and cameramen could be positioned during games to create more open
              space near the baskets.

          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">Micheal Jordan</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Michael Jordan's play and impact on the game influenced the creation
            or modification of three significant NBA rules:
          </p>

          <dl class="lead">
            <dt><strong>The Flagrant Foul Rule:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              This rule was implemented to protect players from excessively hard
              fouls. Jordan's aggressive style of play and his ability to drive
              to the basket often resulted in hard fouls from defenders trying
              to stop him. The league introduced the flagrant foul rule to
              discourage overly physical play and protect offensive players.
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>Hand Checking Rule:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              The NBA banned hand checking in 1994, with further restrictions
              added in 2004. This rule change was partly in response to the
              physical defense used against Jordan. Defenders would often use
              their hands to impede offensive players' movement, particularly
              against elite scorers like Jordan. The removal of hand checking
              made it easier for perimeter players to drive to the basket and
              score.
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>Max Contract Rule:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              While not directly related to on-court play, the max contract rule
              was influenced by Jordan's enormous salary in his final years with
              the Chicago Bulls. In the 1997-98 season, Jordan's salary alone
              exceeded the entire salary cap. This led the NBA to implement a
              maximum salary rule in the 1999 Collective Bargaining Agreement to
              prevent single players from taking up such a large portion of a
              team's salary cap.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p class="lead">
            These rule changes were not solely because of Jordan, but his
            dominance and impact on the game certainly played a significant role
            in their implementation. The changes aimed to improve player safety,
            increase scoring, and maintain competitive balance in the league.

          <p class="lead">
            Zaza Pachulia's actions led to two rule changes in the NBA, often
            referred to as <strong>"Zaza rules"</strong>:
          </p>

          <dl class="lead">
            <dt><strong>The All-Star Voting Rule:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              In 2017, Zaza Pachulia nearly made the All-Star team due to an
              unusual surge in fan votes from his home country of Georgia,
              despite his modest stats. In response, the NBA changed the
              All-Star voting system, making fan votes worth 50% less. This gave
              the NBA more control over the selection process to ensure that
              players are chosen based on merit rather than popularity or
              coordinated voting campaigns.
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>The Closeout Rule:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              During Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference Finals, Pachulia's
              closeout on Kawhi Leonard caused Leonard to land on Pachulia's
              foot, aggravating an ankle injury. This incident was widely
              criticized as a dangerous play. As a result, the NBA implemented a
              rule for the 2017-18 season allowing referees to call flagrant or
              technical fouls on reckless closeouts. Under this rule, defenders
              must allow space for a shooter to land safely after a jump shot.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p class="lead">
            These rule changes were implemented to improve player safety and
            maintain the integrity of the All-Star selection process. The
            closeout rule, in particular, aims to prevent injuries resulting
            from aggressive defensive tactics on jump shooters.

          <p class="lead">
            Shaq was one of the most dominant centres to ever play in the NBA.
            Teams had no one who could match up with the four time NBA champ.
            Because of Shaq‚Äôs dominance, the league allowed teams to employ a
            zone defence to limit his dominance in the shaded area.
            <br />
            While Shaq‚Äôs dominance forced the NBA to make a rule change, his
            weakness also demanded one as well. Shaq dreaded making free throws
            and only made 52.7% at the stripe. As a result, opposing teams
            developed the <strong>Hack-a-Shaq</strong> tactic to offset his
            dominance. In response to this, the league made a rule change that
            will reward the fouled team a free throw and possession of the ball.

          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">James Harden</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            When it comes to scoring, James Harden has turned heads in the
            league. Although his eurosteps and stepbacks have raised eyebrows,
            it‚Äôs his ability to <strong>draw fouls</strong> that catches
            everyone‚Äôs attention. Before the rule change, Harden was averaging
            over <strong>10 free throw attempts per game</strong>.
            <br />
            To limit Harden‚Äôs free throw trips, the league enforced the
            <strong>James Harden rule</strong>. This prevents players from
            <strong>intentionally drawing fouls</strong> with
            <strong>non-basketball moves</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            In the 2021-22 season, the NBA introduced new foul guidelines aimed
            at reducing "non-basketball moves" used to draw fouls.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">The new rules discouraged offensive players from:</p>

          <ul class="lead">
            <li>Leaning into defenders</li>
            <li>Abruptly veering off path</li>
            <li>Jumping into defenders</li>
            <li>Hooking defenders with their off-arm</li>
            <li>
              Using other unnatural motions to create contact and draw fouls
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lead">
            Initially, this change significantly impacted Harden's free throw
            attempts. In the early part of the 2021-22 season, his free throw
            attempts decreased noticeably.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            However, as the season progressed, both players and referees
            adjusted. By about two months into the season, Harden's free throw
            attempts had largely normalized to his previous levels.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The overall impact of the rule change across the NBA was a reduction
            of about 1.5 fewer free throws per game, with roughly the same
            number of total fouls called.

          <p class="lead">
            Shooting is Reggie Miller‚Äôs specialty. Given his competitive nature,
            he would do anything at his disposal to win. Although he was already
            happily retired, the league enforced a rule that gave tribute to the
            former Pacers star which was known as the
            <strong>Reggie Miller Rule</strong>.
            <br />
            The rule prohibits jump shooters from
            <strong>extending any of their legs in order to draw contact</strong
            >. This allows referees to penalise the shooter with an
            <strong>offensive foul</strong> for trying to
            <strong>initiate contact</strong>. Fortunately for Miller, he was
            already done building his legacy.

          <p class="lead">
            If there‚Äôs a player who completely dominated the league (and forced
            the NBA to make early rule Changes) it was Wilt Chamberlain. He
            remains to be the only player in NBA history to score
            <strong>100 points</strong> which speaks for itself. Paired with
            great size and skill, Chamberlain‚Äôs dominance had to be contained by
            the league in order to keep the game interesting and to alleviate
            the size and skill difference between him and his competitors.
            <br />
            Chamberlain forced the league to implement rules that prevented
            <strong>offensive goaltending</strong> and
            <strong>inbounding over the backboard</strong>. Furthermore, he also
            affected <strong>free throw regulations</strong> and forced the
            league to <strong>widen its lanes</strong>.
