          <p class="lead">
            Due to his towering dominance, the NBA made several rule changes for
            George Mikan. For one, there was The Mikan rule which extended NBA
            lanes from six to 12 feet in order to make Mikan move more. Aside
            from that, Mikan was also responsible for rules concerning
            goaltending.
            <br />
            Furthermore, he was also one of the figures that paved the way for
            the 24-second shot clock rule.

            Barkley was a menace in the shaded area despite being undersized. To
            alleviate the lack of size, Barkley often backed down bigger
            defenders for a lengthy amount of time before attempting a shot. In
            order to quicken the pace of the game, the league responded by
            imposing the five second rule or the “Booty rule”.

            If anyone can remember, Paul George suffered a freak injury in a
            Team USA scrimmage while building up for the 2014 FIBA World Cup.
            Fortunately, PG has successfully recovered from the broken leg and
            pieced together a successful comeback story.
            <br />
            In order to prevent this from happening in the NBA stage, the league
            mandated extra space for both sides of the basketball stanchion.

          <p class="lead">
            While buzzer beaters are often celebrated, this one sparked
            controversy. Tucker nailed a game-winning shot at the buzzer with
            only 0.1 remaining. To the ire of Bulls coach Phil Jackson, the shot
            shouldn’t have counted with the time given.
            <br />
            In response to the incident, the Trent Tucker Rule was made. The
            rule limited teams to only make a shot via alley-oop or tip in if
            the clock is less than 0.3 seconds.

            In 1987 the league had to invent the "illegal offence" rule,
            primarily because Michael Jordan specifically was abusing the rules
            to such an extent. The rule change made it illegal to amass the
            offence above the top of the key in order to isolate.

          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">Zaza Pachulia</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            San Antonio Spurs favourite Bruce Bowen was the first to draw the
            NBA's attention on dangerous shot contests, but it was former
            Warriors big man Zaza Pachulia that forced the league to strictly
            enforce this with a more firm rule change. Pachulia was caught in
            the landing space of Spurs Kawhi Leonard while attempting a jump
            shot. This led to Leonard’s injury that played a major role in the
            Spurs’ 4-0 series defeat at the hands of the Warriors.
            <br />
            After the incident, the league implemented a ZaZa rule which now
            allows referees to penalise reckless defenders with technicals and
            flagrants. This helps protect the shooter from injury.
            <br />
            On the side note, Pachulia also played a major role in the NBA’s
            All-Star voting change. Given his popularity in Georgia, Pachulia
            would’ve been an All-Star starter in the festivities using the
            previous format despite riding the bench during the regular season.

          <p class="lead">
            Shaq was one of the most dominant centres to ever play in the NBA.
            Teams had no one who could match up with the four time NBA champ.
            Because of Shaq’s dominance, the league allowed teams to employ a
            zone defence to limit his dominance in the shaded area.
            <br />
            While Shaq’s dominance forced the NBA to make a rule change, his
            weakness also demanded one as well. Shaq dreaded making free throws
            and only made 52.7% at the stripe. As a result, opposing teams
            developed the Hack-a-Shaq tactic to offset his dominance. In
            response to this, the league made a rule change that will reward the
            fouled team a free throw and possession of the ball.

          <p class="lead">
            When it comes to scoring, James Harden has turned heads in the
            league. Although his eurosteps and stepbacks have raised eyebrows,
            it’s his ability to draw fouls that catches everyone’s attention.
            Before the rule change, Harden was averaging over 10 free throw
            attempts per game.
            <br />
            To limit Harden’s free throw trips, the league enforced the James
            Harden rule. This prevents players from intentionally drawing fouls
            with non-basketball moves.

            Shooting is Reggie Miller’s specialty. Given his competitive nature,
            he would do anything at his disposal to win. Although he was already
            happily retired, the league enforced a rule that gave tribute to the
            former Pacers star which was known as the Reggie Miller Rule.
            <br />
            The rule prohibits jump shooters from extending any of their legs in
            order to draw contact. This allows referees to penalise the shooter
            with an offensive foul for trying to initiate contact. Fortunately
            for Miller, he was already done building his legacy.

          <p class="lead">
            If there’s a player who completely dominated the league (and forced
            the NBA to make early rule changes) it was Wilt Chamberlain.
            Chamberlain remains to be the only player in NBA history to score
            100 points which speaks for itself. Paired with great size and
            skill, Chamberlain’s dominance had to be contained by the league in
            order to keep the game interesting and to alleviate the size and
            skill difference between him and his competitors.
            <br />
            Chamberlain forced the league to implement rules that prevented
            offensive goaltending and inbounding over the backboard.
            Furthermore, he also affected free throw regulations and forced the
            league to widen its lanes.
