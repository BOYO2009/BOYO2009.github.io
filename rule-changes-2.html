          <p class="lead">
            Due to his towering dominance, the NBA made
            <strong>several rule changes</strong> for George Mikan. For one,
            there was <em>'The Mikan rule'</em> which
            <strong>extended</strong> NBA lanes from
            <strong>6 to 12</strong> feet in order to make Mikan move more.
            Aside from that, Mikan was also responsible for rules concerning
            <strong>goaltending</strong>.
            <br />
            Furthermore, he was also one of the figures that paved the way for
            the <strong>24-second shot clock rule</strong>.

            Barkley was a menace in the shaded area despite being undersized. To
            alleviate the lack of size, Barkley often
            <strong>backed down</strong> bigger defenders for a
            <em>lengthy</em> amount of time before attempting a shot. In order
            to quicken the pace of the game, the league responded by imposing
            the <strong>five second rule</strong> or the
            <strong>‚ÄúBooty rule‚Äù</strong>.

            successfully <strong>recovered</strong> from the broken leg and

            <br />
            In order to <strong>prevent</strong> this from happening in the NBA
            stage, the league <strong>mandated extra space</strong> for both

            In 1987 the league had to invent the
            <strong>"illegal offence"</strong> rule, primarily because
            <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> specifically was
            <strong>abusing</strong> the rules to such an extent. The rule
            change made it <strong>illegal</strong> to amass the offence above
            the <strong>top of the key</strong> in order to isolate.

          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">Zaza Pachulia</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            San Antonio Spurs favourite Bruce Bowen was the first to draw the
            NBA's attention on <strong>dangerous</strong> shot contests, but it
            was former Warriors big man <strong>Zaza Pachulia</strong> that
            forced the league to strictly enforce this with a moro
            <strong>firm</strong> rule change. Zaza Pachulia was caught in the
            <strong>landing space</strong> of Spurs
            <strong>Kawhi Leonard</strong> while attempting a jump shot. This
            led to Leonard‚Äôs injury that played a <strong>major role</strong> in
            the Spurs 4-0 series defeat at the hands of the Warriors.
            <br />
            After the incident, the league implemented
            <strong>The ZaZa rule</strong>, which now allows referees to
            penalise <strong>reckless defenders</strong> with technicals and
            flagrants. This helps protect the shooter from injury.
            <br />
            On the side note, Pachulia also played a major role in the NBA‚Äôs
            <strong>All-Star voting change</strong>. Given his popularity in
            Georgia, Pachulia would‚Äôve been an All-Star starter in the
            festivities using the previous format despite riding the bench
            during the regular season.

          <p class="lead">
            Shaq was one of the most <strong>dominant centres</strong> to ever
            play in the NBA. Teams had no one who could match up with the four
            time NBA champ. Because of Shaq‚Äôs dominance, the league allowed
            teams to employ a <strong>zone defence</strong> to
            <strong>limit</strong> his dominance in the shaded area.
            <br />
            While Shaq‚Äôs dominance forced the NBA to make a
            <strong>rule change</strong>, his weakness also demanded one as
            well. Shaq dreaded making free throws and only made
            <strong>52.7%</strong> at the stripe. As a result, opposing teams
            developed the <strong>>Hack-a-Shaq</strong> tactic to offset his
            dominance. In response to this, the league made a
            <strong>rule change</strong> that will <strong>reward</strong> the
            fouled team a <strong>free throw</strong> and
            <strong>possession of the ball</strong>.

          <p class="lead">
            When it comes to <strong>scoring</strong>, James Harden has turned
            heads in the league. Although his <strong>eurosteps</strong> and
            <strong>stepbacks</strong> have raised eyebrows, it‚Äôs his ability to
            <strong>draw fouls</strong> that catches everyone‚Äôs attention.
            Before the rule change, Harden was averaging over
            <strong>10 free throw attempts per game</strong>.
            <br />
            To limit Harden‚Äôs free throw trips, the league enforced the
            <strong>James Harden rule</strong>. This prevents players from

            Shooting is Reggie Miller‚Äôs specialty. Given his
            <strong>competitive nature</strong>, he would do anything at his
            disposal to <strong>win</strong>. Although he was already happily
            retired, the league <strong>enforced</strong> a rule that gave
            tribute to the former Pacers star which was known as the
            <strong>Reggie Miller Rule</strong>.
            <br />
            The rule <strong>prohibits</strong> jump shooters from
            <strong>extending any of their legs</strong> in order to
            <strong>draw contact</strong>. This allows referees to penalise the
            shooter with an <strong>offensive foul</strong> for trying to
            <strong>initiate contact</strong>. Fortunately for Miller, he was
            already done building his legacy.

          <p class="lead">
            If there‚Äôs a player who completely dominated the league (and
            <strong>forced</strong> the NBA to make early
            <strong>rule changes</strong>) it was Wilt Chamberlain. Chamberlain
            remains to be the <strong>only player</strong> in NBA history to
            scores <strong>100 points</strong> which speaks for itself. Paired
            with <strong>great size and skill</strong>, Chamberlain‚Äôs dominance
            had to be contained by the league in order to keep the game
            interesting and to <strong>alleviate</strong> the size and skill
            difference between him and his competitors.
            <br />
            Chamberlain forced the league to
            <strong>implement rules</strong> that prevented
            <strong>offensive goaltending</strong> and
            <strong>inbounding</strong> over the backboard. Furthermore, he also
            affected <strong>free throw regulations</strong> and forced the
            league to <strong>widen</strong> its lanes.
