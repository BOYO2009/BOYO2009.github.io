    <h2>The Three-Point Revolution: Changing the Geometry of the Game</h2>

    <p>
      In the 2010s, Stephen Curry's exceptional three-point shooting skills
      revolutionised basketball strategy. His influence shifted the game's focus
      towards perimeter shooting, leading to a new era where the three-point
      shot became a central offensive weapon for teams across the league.
