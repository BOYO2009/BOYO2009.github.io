            In the 13 seasons he spent with the Boston Celtics, Bill Russell won
            a whopping <strong>11 NBA titles</strong> and was named an
            <strong>All-Star</strong>
            a dozen times. A <strong>five-time</strong> winner of the
            <strong>MVP award</strong>, Russell’s
            <strong>shot-blocking skills</strong> were simply legendary, and his
            defence and rebounding abilities weren’t too shabby, either. Just as
            notably, the <strong>Hall of Fame hero</strong> was the
            <strong>first African American star</strong> in NBA history, and its
            <strong>first championship-winning player-coach</strong>.
            <br />
            He won <strong>11 NBA titles</strong> in the 13 seasons that he

            <strong>first African American coach</strong> of a modern major
            professional sports team in the United States when he was named the
            player-coach of the Celtics in 1966. Born: February 12, 1934,

            A truly magical talent, Earvin ‘Magic’ Johnson helped
            <strong>revolutionise the point guard position</strong>, and
            provided the <strong>fast-break flair</strong> that made the
            Showtime Lakers such a wonder to watch. A
            <strong>five-time NBA champion</strong> and
            <strong>three-time MVP</strong>, Johnson’s career came to an abrupt
            end in 1991 after he revealed he was HIV-positive. Even so, Magic
            still left with the <strong>second-most triple-doubles</strong> in
            NBA history, behind only Oscar Robertson.
            <br />
            Known for his <strong>extraordinary court vision</strong>,
            <strong>passing abilities</strong>, and <strong>leadership</strong>,
            Johnson was one of the most dominant players of his era. His career

            <strong>Hall of Fame legend</strong> Wilt Chamberlain also managed

          <p class="lead">
            A sharp-shooting forward who spent his entire career with the
            Celtics, <strong>Hall of Famer</strong> Larry Bird played on three
            NBA championship-winning teams during his brilliant run in Boston. A
            <strong>three-time MVP</strong> and
            <strong>12-time All-Star</strong>, Bird is the charter member of the
            50-40-90 club, a seven-man crew of stars who managed to post
            season-long shooting percentages of at least <strong>50%</strong> on
            field goals, <strong>40%</strong> on 3-pointers, and
            <strong>90%</strong> on free throws.
            <br />
            Bird's all-around game and clutch shooting
            <strong>redefined</strong> the small forward position and turned the
            Celtics back into winners. Bird's
            <strong>mastery of fundamentals</strong> and competitive spirit
            rejuvenated both the NBA and the Celtics, alongside fellow rookie
            and Los Angeles Lakers player Magic Johnson. When Bird retired in
            1992, he held <strong>27 Celtics records</strong> and brought
            <strong>three more championship</strong> banners to Boston (1981,
            1984, 1986).

            <strong>7’1</strong> and topped the scales at more than 325 pounds
            and sometimes way more. With Kobe Bryant by his side (sort of), Shaq
            won <strong>three consecutive NBA titles</strong> with the Los
            Angeles Lakers from 2000 to 2002. After he and Kobe split, Shaq
            added a <strong>fourth crown</strong> while playing with Dwyane Wade
            and the Miami Heat in 2006.
            <br />
            Shaq's individual accolades include the 1999–2000
            <strong>MVP award</strong>, the 1992–93
            <strong>NBA Rookie of the Year award</strong>,

            <strong>All-NBA</strong> and <strong>All-Defensive teams</strong> in
            each of his first 13 seasons. He spent his entire 19-year career

            Kobe Bryant was a ruthless scorer who always seemed able to squeeze
            off a shot, no matter how tough it looked. A
            <strong>five-time NBA champion</strong>, Bryant retired as the
            <strong>third-leading scorer</strong> in league history, trailing
            only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone.
            <br />
            Kobe's model of <strong>excellence</strong> was also reflected in
            everything he touched, and that applies to the Lakers and the NBA as
            a whole. Even in retirement, Kobe Bryant's name meant
            <strong>hard work</strong> and <strong>inspiration</strong> to many
            people. That became part of American culture.

            An ageing Hakeem Olajuwon had lost some of his lustre by the time he
            wound up with the Toronto Raptors. But during his days with the
            Houston Rockets, <strong>‘The Dream’</strong> was a towering
            presence in the paint who led his team to
            <strong>>back-to-back NBA titles</strong> in 1994 and 1995. The
            Nigerian-born <strong>seven-footer</strong> led the league in
            rebounding in two different seasons, and was a
            <strong>three-time leader</strong> in blocked shots. In 1994, the
            <strong>Hall of Fame centre</strong> became the only player in NBA
            history to be named <strong>MVP</strong>,
            <strong>defensive player of the year</strong>, and
            <strong>Finals MVP</strong> all in the same season.
            <br />
            He led the Houston Rockets to
            <strong>back-to-back NBA championships</strong> in 1994 and 1995 and
            was named <strong>Finals MVP</strong> both years. Selected to
            <strong>twelve NBA All Star games</strong>, Olajuwon holds the NBA
            <strong>record for blocked shots (3,830)</strong> and is the only
            player to record more than <strong>3,000 blocked shots</strong> and

            <strong>‘The Round Mound of Rebound.’</strong> An
            <strong>11-time All-Star</strong>, Barkley was named
            <strong>MVP</strong> in 1993, when his Phoenix Suns lost to Michael
            Jordan’s Chicago Bulls in the NBA Finals. A
            <strong>two-time Olympic gold medal winner</strong> and
            <strong>Hall of Famer</strong>, Barkley wasn’t the tallest player on
            the court, but had more than enough strength and agility to beat
            opponents to the ball.
            <br />
            In the 1986–87 season, Barkley led the league in rebounding average
            and earned his first <strong>rebounding title</strong>. He was named
            the <strong>All-Star Game MVP</strong> in 1991, and in 1993 with the
            Phoenix Suns, he was voted the <strong>league's MVP</strong> while

          <p class="lead">
            The <strong>second-highest scorer</strong> in NBA history, Karl
            Malone was a dominant figure at both ends of the floor for the Utah
            Jazz. Nicknamed <strong>‘The Mailman’</strong> for his consistent
            delivery of quality play, Malone was incredibly durable, missing
            just a handful of games over his 19-year career. A
            <strong>two-time league MVP</strong>, he teamed with John Stockton
            to lead the Jazz to <strong>consecutive NBA Finals</strong>, but
            couldn’t get the better of Michael Jordan and the Bulls.
            <br />
            Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985–2003) in the NBA with the
            Utah Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate John
            Stockton. He was a
            <strong>two-time NBA Most Valuable Player</strong>, a
            <strong>14-time NBA All-Star</strong>, and a
            <strong>13-time member of the All-NBA Team</strong>, which include
            <strong>11 consecutive First Team selection</strong>.

          <p class="lead">
            They called him <strong>‘Mr. Clutch’</strong> in honour of his
            ability to hit big shots in big games. But Jerry West was also
            immortalised in another way: his silhouette was used for the NBA
            logo. A <strong>14-time All-Star</strong> in his career with the Los
            Angeles Lakers, West played in <strong>nine NBA Finals</strong> but
            only won once, capturing his <strong>lone championship</strong> in
            1972. He’s also the only player to be named
            <strong>Finals MVP</strong> despite ending up on the losing side, a
            feat he achieved in 1969.
            <br />
            He shaped squads that won <strong>five NBA titles</strong> between
            1982 and 2000, his final year with the franchise. West worked in the
            front office of the Memphis Grizzlies from 2002 to 2007, assembling
            the <strong>first playoff teams</strong> for the young franchise.
            His front-office acumen led to
            <strong>two NBA Executive of the Year awards</strong> (1995, 2004).

          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">Steve Nash</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Nash led the league in assists and free throw percentage at various
            points in his career. He is also ranked as
            <strong>one of the top players in NBA league history</strong> in
            three-point shooting, free throw shooting, total assists, and
            assists per game. In 2018, he was inducted into the
            <strong>>Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</strong>.
            <br />
            While other players may have put up bigger scoring and rebounding
            totals, or played more imposing defence. But very few have done what
            Steve Nash did: engineer a highly entertaining
            <strong>high-octane offence</strong> while managing to effectively
            involve all his teammates. A <strong>two-time MVP</strong> who never
            won a league championship, the Canadian point guard retired with the
            <strong>third-highest assist total</strong> in NBA history. He’s
            also the only <strong>four-time member</strong> of the
            <strong>50-40-90 club</strong> (a seven-man group of stars who had
            season-long shooting percentages of at least
            <strong>50% on field goals</strong>,
            <strong>40% on 3-pointers</strong>, and
            <strong>90% on free throws</strong>).
