  <h1>10 NBA Players That Caused Rule Changes</h1>

  <body>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>George Mikan</h3>
        <p>
          Due to his towering dominance, the NBA made several rule changes for
          George Mikan. For one, there was The Mikan rule which extended NBA
          lanes from six to 12 feet in order to make Mikan move more. Aside from
          that, Mikan was also responsible for rules concerning goaltending.
          <br />
          Furthermore, he was also one of the figures that paved the way for the
          24-second shot clock rule.

      <li>
        <h3>Charles Barkley</h3>
        <p>
          Barkley was a menace in the shaded area despite being undersized. To
          alleviate the lack of size, Barkley often backed down bigger defenders
          for a lengthy amount of time before attempting a shot. In order to
          quicken the pace of the game, the league responded by imposing the
          five second rule or the “Booty rule”.

      <br />

      <li>
        <h3>Paul Goerge</h3>
        <p>
          If anyone can remember, Paul George suffered a freak injury in a Team
          USA scrimmage while building up for the 2014 FIBA World Cup.
          Fortunately, PG has successfully recovered from the broken leg and
          pieced together a successful comeback story.
          <br />
          In order to prevent this from happening in the NBA stage, the league
          mandated extra space for both sides of the basketball stanchion.
        </p>

      <li>
        <h3>Trent Tucker</h3>
        <p>
          While buzzer beaters are often celebrated, this one sparked
          controversy. Tucker nailed a game-winning shot at the buzzer with only
          0.1 remaining. To the ire of Bulls coach Phil Jackson, the shot
          shouldn’t have counted with the time given.
          <br />
          In response to the incident, the Trent Tucker Rule was made. The rule
          limited teams to only make a shot via alley-oop or tip in if the clock
          is less than 0.3 seconds.

      <li>
        <h3>Micheal Jordan</h3>
        <p>
          In 1987 the league had to invent the "illegal offence" rule, primarily
          because Michael Jordan specifically was abusing the rules to such an
          extent. The rule change made it illegal to amass the offence above the
          top of the key in order to isolate.

      <br />
      <br />

      <li>
        <h3>Zaza Pachulia</h3>
        <p>
          San Antonio Spurs favourite Bruce Bowen was the first to draw the
          NBA's attention on dangerous shot contests, but it was former Warriors
          big man Zaza Pachulia that forced the league to strictly enforce this
          with a more firm rule change. Pachulia was caught in the landing space
          of Spurs Kawhi Leonard while attempting a jump shot. This led to
          Leonard’s injury that played a major role in the Spurs’ 4-0 series
          defeat at the hands of the Warriors.
          <br />
          After the incident, the league implemented a ZaZa rule which now
          allows referees to penalise reckless defenders with technicals and
          flagrants. This helps protect the shooter from injury.
          <br />
          On the side note, Pachulia also played a major role in the NBA’s
          All-Star voting change. Given his popularity in Georgia, Pachulia
          would’ve been an All-Star starter in the festivities using the
          previous format despite riding the bench during the regular season.

      <li>
        <h3>Shaquille O’Neal</h3>
        <p>
          Shaq was one of the most dominant centres to ever play in the NBA.
          Teams had no one who could match up with the four time NBA champ.
          Because of Shaq’s dominance, the league allowed teams to employ a zone
          defence to limit his dominance in the shaded area.
          <br />
          While Shaq’s dominance forced the NBA to make a rule change, his
          weakness also demanded one as well. Shaq dreaded making free throws
          and only made 52.7% at the stripe. As a result, opposing teams
          developed the Hack-a-Shaq tactic to offset his dominance. In response
          to this, the league made a rule change that will reward the fouled
          team a free throw and possession of the ball.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>James Harden</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to scoring, James Harden has turned heads in the league.
          Although his eurosteps and stepbacks have raised eyebrows, it’s his
          ability to draw fouls that catches everyone’s attention. Before the
          rule change, Harden was averaging over 10 free throw attempts per
          game.
          <br />
          To limit Harden’s free throw trips, the league enforced the James
          Harden rule. This prevents players from intentionally drawing fouls
          with non-basketball moves.

      <br />

      <li>
        <h3>Reggie Miller</h3>
        <p>
          Shooting is Reggie Miller’s specialty. Given his competitive nature,
          he would do anything at his disposal to win. Although he was already
          happily retired, the league enforced a rule that gave tribute to the
          former Pacers star which was known as the Reggie Miller Rule.
          <br />
          The rule prohibits jump shooters from extending any of their legs in
          order to draw contact. This allows referees to penalise the shooter
          with an offensive foul for trying to initiate contact. Fortunately for
          Miller, he was already done building his legacy.

      <br />
      <br />

      <li>
        <h3>Wilt Chamberlain</h3>
        <p>
          If there’s a player who completely dominated the league (and forced
          the NBA to make early rule changes) it was Wilt Chamberlain.
          Chamberlain remains to be the only player in NBA history to score 100
          points which speaks for itself. Paired with great size and skill,
          Chamberlain’s dominance had to be contained by the league in order to
          keep the game interesting and to alleviate the size and skill
          difference between him and his competitors.
          <br />
          Chamberlain forced the league to implement rules that prevented
          offensive goaltending and inbounding over the backboard. Furthermore,
          he also affected free throw regulations and forced the league to widen
          its lanes.
