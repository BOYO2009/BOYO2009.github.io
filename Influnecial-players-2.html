          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">Michael Jordan</h2>
          <p class="lead">One day, Michael Jordan may have to cede the title of greatest ever to
            LeBron James, or maybe even another challenger to the throne. For now,
            however, His Royal Airness rests alone as the crown prince of
            basketball royalty. A five-time league MVP and six-time NBA champion
            with the Chicago Bulls, the Hall of Fame legend boasts the highest
            scoring average in league history in both regular season play and the
            playoffs.
            <br />
            Michael Jordan transformed the NBA through his unmatched athleticism
            and skill, setting new standards for performance and excitement. He
            became an international superstar, significantly expanding the NBA's
            global popularity. His influence extended beyond the court, impacting
            the business and cultural aspects of the sport, including endorsements
            and media presence. Jordan's legacy continues to shape the NBA,
            inspiring players and captivating fans worldwide.</p>

          <p class="lead">They call him King James, and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James
            sure boasts regal talent. A fixture in the NBA Finals in recent years,
            James has won four rings in his career. A four-time league MVP,
            17-time All-Star, and two-time Olympic gold medallist, LBJ is
            unquestionably the most dominant player of his era.
            <br />
            Twenty years and countless lives changed later, that kid, now in his
            21st NBA season, continues to pour his heart into the game he fell in
            love with as a child. Along the way, he earned four championships,
            four MVPs, 19 All Star selections and holds the record for most points
            scored in the history of the league.</p>

          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
          <p class="lead">TA teammate of Magic Johnson on the Los Angeles Lakers teams that
            dominated the NBA in the 1980s, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played for six NBA
            championship teams in his long and distinguished career. Famous for
            his ‘skyhook’ shot, this high-scoring Hall of Fame centre set records
            by winning six NBA MVP awards and earning 19 All-Star selections.
            <br />
            Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known for his trademark sky hook, is the NBA's
            all-time leading scorer. When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left the game in
            1989 at age 42, no NBA player had ever scored more points, blocked
            more shots, won more Most Valuable Player Awards, played in more
            All-Star Games or logged more seasons.</p>

          <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1">Bill Russel</h2>
          <p class="lead">In the 13 seasons he spent with the Boston Celtics, Bill Russell won a
            whopping 11 NBA titles and was named an All-Star a dozen times. A
            five-time winner of the MVP award, Russell’s shot-blocking skills were
            simply legendary, and his defence and rebounding abilities weren’t too
            shabby, either. Just as notably, the Hall of Fame hero was the first
            African American star in NBA history, and its first
            championship-winning player-coach.
            <br />
            He won 11 NBA titles in the 13 seasons that he played with the Boston
            Celtics, and he became the first African American coach of a modern
            major professional sports team in the United States when he was named
            the player-coach of the Celtics in 1966. Born: February 12, 1934,
            Monroe, Louisiana, U.S.</p>
