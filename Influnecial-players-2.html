          <p class="lead">
            One day, Michael Jordan may have to cede the title of greatest ever
            to LeBron James, or maybe even another challenger to the throne. For
            now, however, His Royal Airness rests alone as the crown prince of
            basketball royalty. A five-time league MVP and six-time NBA champion
            with the Chicago Bulls, the Hall of Fame legend boasts the highest
            scoring average in league history in both regular season play and
            the playoffs.
            <br />
            Michael Jordan transformed the NBA through his unmatched athleticism
            and skill, setting new standards for performance and excitement. He
            became an international superstar, significantly expanding the NBA's
            global popularity. His influence extended beyond the court,
            impacting the business and cultural aspects of the sport, including
            endorsements and media presence. Jordan's legacy continues to shape
            the NBA, inspiring players and captivating fans worldwide.

            They call him King James, and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James
            sure boasts regal talent. A fixture in the NBA Finals in recent
            years, James has won four rings in his career. A four-time league
            MVP, 17-time All-Star, and two-time Olympic gold medallist, LBJ is
            unquestionably the most dominant player of his era.

            Twenty years and countless lives changed later, that kid, now in his

            TA teammate of Magic Johnson on the Los Angeles Lakers teams that
            dominated the NBA in the 1980s, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played for six
            NBA championship teams in his long and distinguished career. Famous
            for his ‘skyhook’ shot, this high-scoring Hall of Fame centre set
            records by winning six NBA MVP awards and earning 19 All-Star
            selections.
            <br />
            Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known for his trademark sky hook, is the NBA's
            all-time leading scorer. When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left the game in

          <p class="lead">
            In the 13 seasons he spent with the Boston Celtics, Bill Russell won
            a whopping 11 NBA titles and was named an All-Star a dozen times. A
            five-time winner of the MVP award, Russell’s shot-blocking skills
            were simply legendary, and his defence and rebounding abilities
            weren’t too shabby, either. Just as notably, the Hall of Fame hero
            was the first African American star in NBA history, and its first
            championship-winning player-coach.
            <br />
            He won 11 NBA titles in the 13 seasons that he played with the
            Boston Celtics, and he became the first African American coach of a
            modern major professional sports team in the United States when he
            was named the player-coach of the Celtics in 1966. Born: February
            12, 1934, Monroe, Louisiana, U.S.

          <p class="lead">
            A truly magical talent, Earvin ‘Magic’ Johnson helped revolutionise
            the point guard position, and provided the fast-break flair that
            made the Showtime Lakers such a wonder to watch. A five-time NBA
            champion and three-time MVP, Johnson’s career came to an abrupt end
            in 1991 after he revealed he was HIV-positive. Even so, Magic still
            left with the second-most triple-doubles in NBA history, behind only
            Oscar Robertson.
            <br />
            Known for his extraordinary court vision, passing abilities, and
            leadership, Johnson was one of the most dominant players of his era.
            His career achievements include three NBA Most Valuable Player
            Awards, three NBA Finals MVPs, nine All-NBA First Team designations,
            and twelve All-Star games selections.

            The only man to score 100 points in a single NBA game, and the only
            one to average 50 points per game over an entire season, Hall of
            Fame legend Wilt Chamberlain also managed to lead the league in
            assists one year, showing he was more than just a relentless scoring
            machine. A four-time MVP, ‘Wilt the Stilt’ was also a two-time NBA
            champion, winning one title with his hometown Philadelphia 76ers and
            a second with the Los Angeles Lakers.
            <br />
            More than 7 feet (2.1 metres) tall, Chamberlain was an outstanding
            centre. During his 1961–62 season he became the first player to
            score more than 4,000 points in a National Basketball Association
            (NBA) season, with 4,029, averaging 50.4 points per game.

          <p class="lead">
            A sharp-shooting forward who spent his entire career with the
            Celtics, Hall of Famer Larry Bird played on three NBA
            championship-winning teams during his brilliant run in Boston. A
            three-time MVP and 12-time All-Star, Bird is the charter member of
            the 50-40-90 club, a seven-man crew of stars who managed to post
            season-long shooting percentages of at least 50% on field goals, 40%
            on 3-pointers, and 90% on free throws.
            <br />
            Bird's all-around game and clutch shooting redefined the small
            forward position and turned the Celtics back into winners. Bird's
            mastery of fundamentals and competitive spirit rejuvenated both the
            NBA and the Celtics, alongside fellow rookie and Los Angeles Lakers
            player Magic Johnson. When Bird retired in 1992, he held 27 Celtics
            records and brought three more championship banners to Boston (1981,
            1984, 1986).

            With Kobe Bryant by his side (sort of), Shaq won three consecutive
            NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers from 2000 to 2002. After he
            and Kobe split, Shaq added a fourth crown while playing with Dwyane
            Wade and the Miami Heat in 2006.
            <br />
            Shaq's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 MVP award, the

          <p class="lead">
            Kobe Bryant was a ruthless scorer who always seemed able to squeeze
            off a shot, no matter how tough it looked. A five-time NBA champion,
            Bryant retired as the third-leading scorer in league history,
            trailing only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone.
            <br />
            Kobe's model of excellence was also reflected in everything he
            touched, and that applies to the Lakers and the NBA as a whole. Even
            in retirement, Kobe Bryant's name meant hard work and inspiration to
            many people. That became part of American culture.

            An ageing Hakeem Olajuwon had lost some of his lustre by the time he
            wound up with the Toronto Raptors. But during his days with the
            Houston Rockets, ‘The Dream’ was a towering presence in the paint
            who led his team to back-to-back NBA titles in 1994 and 1995. The
            Nigerian-born seven-footer led the league in rebounding in two
            different seasons, and was a three-time leader in blocked shots. In
            1994, the Hall of Fame centre became the only player in NBA history
            to be named MVP, defensive player of the year, and Finals MVP all in
            the same season.
            <br />
            He led the Houston Rockets to back-to-back NBA championships in 1994
            and 1995 and was named Finals MVP both years. Selected to twelve NBA
            All Star games, Olajuwon holds the NBA record for blocked shots
            (3,830) and is the only player to record more than 3,000 blocked
            shots and 2,000 steals in a career.

            An above-the-rim artist who excelled at throwing down spectacular
            soaring dunks, Julius Erving deserves a special place in the
            pantheon of hoops stars because his high-flying style influenced a
            legion of devoted followers. A two-time champion in the ABA, and
            league MVP in three straight seasons, ‘Dr. J’ went on to win a third
            title and a fourth MVP award after joining the NBA’s Philadelphia
            76ers.
            <br />
            Erving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player awards and
            three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York
            Nets (now the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers.
            During his 16 seasons as a player, none of his teams ever missed the
            postseason.

            Malone led the NBA in rebounding six times, and averaged more than
            20 points per game for 11 consecutive seasons. He averaged a
            double-double in points and rebounds for his career. Malone teamed
            with Hall of Famer Julius Erving to bring Philadelphia the 1983 NBA
            championship.
            <br />
            Hall of Famer Moses Malone won his only NBA title with the
            Philadelphia 76ers in 1983, the same season he also won MVP and
            Finals MVP honours. One of eight players to win three MVP awards,
            Malone was a legendary rebounder known as ‘The Chairman of the
            Boards.’ He posted league-leading rebounding numbers in six
            different seasons, including five straight at one stretch, and
            retired with the most offensive rebounds in basketball history.

            illustrious career, far and away the highest total of all time. An
            NBA champion with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971, ‘The Big O’ was a
            brilliant point guard who could beat you with his scoring, by
            setting up his teammates with assists, or by picking up a pile of
            rebounds. An innovative star who is credited with inventing both the
            head fake and the fadeaway jump shot, Robertson retired as the NBA’s
            career leader in both assists and made free throws.

            This long-range assassin is still very active, with plenty of years
            still to come in what has already been an astonishing career.
            Considered by some to be the greatest shooter the game has ever
            seen, Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry established an NBA
            record by making 402 3-point shots in the 2015-16 season. Curry's
            shooting range has forced defences to adapt, stretching the floor
            and creating more space for his teammates. This has led to a
            league-wide shift towards prioritising three-point shooting, with
            teams now emphasising spacing and long-range accuracy.

            Charles Barkley is one of six players in NBA history to score at
            least 20,000 points, grab 10,000 rebounds, and dish out 4,000
            assists. To some, he was Sir Charles. To others, he was better known
            as ‘The Round Mound of Rebound.’ An 11-time All-Star, Barkley was
            named MVP in 1993, when his Phoenix Suns lost to Michael Jordan’s
            Chicago Bulls in the NBA Finals. A two-time Olympic gold medal
            winner and Hall of Famer, Barkley wasn’t the tallest player on the
            court, but had more than enough strength and agility to beat
            opponents to the ball.
            <br />
            In the 1986–87 season, Barkley led the league in rebounding average
            and earned his first rebounding title. He was named the All-Star
            Game MVP in 1991, and in 1993 with the Phoenix Suns, he was voted
            the league's MVP while leading the team to the NBA Finals.

            The second-highest scorer in NBA history, Karl Malone was a dominant
            figure at both ends of the floor for the Utah Jazz. Nicknamed ‘The
            Mailman’ for his consistent delivery of quality play, Malone was
            incredibly durable, missing just a handful of games over his 19-year
            career. A two-time league MVP, he teamed with John Stockton to lead
            the Jazz to consecutive NBA Finals, but couldn’t get the better of
            Michael Jordan and the Bulls.
            <br />
            Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985–2003) in the NBA with the
            Utah Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate John
            Stockton. He was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, a 14-time NBA
            All-Star, and a 13-time member of the All-NBA Team, which include 11
            consecutive First Team selection.

            way: his silhouette was used for the NBA logo. A 14-time All-Star in
            his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, West played in nine NBA
            Finals but only won once, capturing his lone championship in 1972.
            He’s also the only player to be named Finals MVP despite ending up
            on the losing side, a feat he achieved in 1969.
            <br />
            He shaped squads that won five NBA titles between 1982 and 2000, his
            final year with the franchise. West worked in the front office of
            the Memphis Grizzlies from 2002 to 2007, assembling the first
            playoff teams for the young franchise. His front-office acumen led

          <p class="lead">
            Nash led the league in assists and free throw percentage at various
            points in his career. He is also ranked as one of the top players in
            NBA league history in three-point shooting, free throw shooting,
            total assists, and assists per game. In 2018, he was inducted into
            the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

            While other players may have put up bigger scoring and rebounding
            totals, or played more imposing defence. But very few have done what
            Steve Nash did: engineer a highly entertaining high-octane offence
            while managing to effectively involve all his teammates. A two-time
            MVP who never won a league championship, the Canadian point guard
            retired with the third-highest assist total in NBA history. He’s
            also the only four-time member of the 50-40-90 club (a seven-man
            group of stars who had season-long shooting percentages of at least
            50% on field goals, 40% on 3-pointers, and 90% on free throws).
